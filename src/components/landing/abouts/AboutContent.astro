      I have been a software engineer for well over a decade. My passion is
      working with PHP&mdash;specifically the TALL stack (Tailwind, Alpine.js,
      Laravel, Livewire)... however, I love working in all aspects of the
      codebase and SDLC.

      I am as comfortable working in the cloud as I am slinging code; few things
      excite me more than learning something new!
